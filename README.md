# Personal-Fedora-Setup

Just a quick post install script, will add more detail here later, for now the code is self explanatory.

Just run the setup depending on what system you are on.

For KDE desktop environments run:
```bash
./kde-setup.sh
```

For Gnome desktop environments run:
```bash
./gnome-setup.sh
```
